**Hi**, My name is  Zindy Yasrah Sallum, here I will create a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to make a classification model to predict brain tumors.


## **About the dataset**

I'm going to use the dataset "Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection," which was obtained from Kaggle and uploaded by NAVONEEL CHAKRABARTY. The dataset contains MRI scan images of the human brain, classified as either tumor or normal.

* no = no tumor, encoded as 0  
* yes = tumor, encoded as 1

## **Objective**

I will assist medical personnel by creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify brain tumors from MRI scan results and predict the difference between tumorous brains and normal brains.
